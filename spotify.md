Copy the entire string (in the blue box) and paste inside the ApprovalCode textbox in the plugin, and you're all set!

### Current features

- All basic features are supported: Play/Pause/Next/Previous
- **Playlist support** allows you to switch to your favorite playlist
- **Volume control** allows you to mute/unmute and increase/decrease the volume by whatever amount you choose
- Play/Pause Toggle option which also shows you the current time elapsed of the song
- Option to select which device you want to control (This is availabile under the Play action. See next section as this may be needed in your setup)

### Nothing happens when I click the buttons
If you have multiple devices configured in Spotify, and none of them are playing, you will need to first choose which device to control. Make sure Spotify is loaded on your computer and drag a new Spotify action to your Stream Deck. Choose the "Play" action and then choose your device under the "Device" field. Click the button on your Stream Deck and it will start playing on the choosen device.
