# Spotify Plugin for the Elgato Stream Deck

## How do I get this?
* Download from our [Discord server](http://discord.barraider.com)
* Follow the instructions **exactly** as shown in the wizard.

### Usage
Please note, to use this plugin you need to authorize this app to communicate with your Spotify account. After installing the plugin, drag it to your Stream Deck and click on the button to enable the setup wizard.

Choosing a Device in the Play, Play/Pause Toggle or "Start Playlist" actions is **REQUIRED**. Failure to do so may result in not being able to control Spotify until you manually start playing on the device.

### Help! Nothing happens when I click the buttons
If you have multiple devices configured in Spotify, and none of them are playing, you will need to first choose which device to control. Make sure Spotify is loaded on the device you want to control (and preferably playing) and drag a new Spotify action to your Stream Deck. Choose the "Play" action and then choose that device under the "Device" field. If done correctly, the key's icon on Stream Deck should change. Click the button on your Stream Deck and it will start playing on the chosen device.
