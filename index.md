### What's new?
Besides new projects, I'm also planning on  doing a few Twitch streams on how to create Stream Deck plugins, hear feedback and ideas on additional plugins to create, and maybe even just teaching basic coding skills.   
If you think that'll interest you (or just want to help my Twitch channel), feel free to [follow me on twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/barraider) .
