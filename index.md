### What's new?
2019-01-19: **Introducing Stream Deck Screen Saver**! An app that allows you to choose an image that will automatically be shown on your Stream Deck every time you lock your computer.  
For more information see the [Stream Deck Screen Saver Project Page](/sdscreensaver)

Besides new projects, I'm also planning on  doing a few Twitch streams on how to create Stream Deck plugins, hear feedback and ideas on additional plugins to create, and maybe even just teaching basic coding skills.   
If you think that'll interest you (or just want to help my Twitch channel), feel free to [follow me on twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/barraider) .
