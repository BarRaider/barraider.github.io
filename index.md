2019-03-30: New Plugin! Introducing the **Super Macros** plugin - Advanced keystroke macros triggered by the Elgato Stream Deck. Simulates a keyboard and also allows you to choose the delay between each key press (between 1ms to 2000ms). Supports combination of commands such as {Shift-Home}+{Ctrl-C} [Select a row text and copy to clipboard] to create complex macros. Allows a high details of customization, to allow you to make sophisticated macros. [Project page](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-supermacro/blob/master/README.md)

2019-03-03: **Stream Deck Tools v2.0 released!** The library is aimed to make Plugin development for the StreamDeck as rapid as possible. It encapsulates all the overhead of communicating with the Stream Deck, so you can focus on writing the plugin itself. Get StreamDeck-Tools from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StreamDeck-Tools/) for more instructions on how to use the StreamDeck-tools, see the [Project page](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools)

Head over to the <a href="/spotify">Project page</a> for more details and download link.

### What's coming next?
Besides new projects, I'm also planning on  doing a few Twitch streams on how to create Stream Deck plugins, hear feedback and ideas on additional plugins to create, and maybe even just teaching basic coding skills.   
If you think that'll interest you (or just want to help my Twitch channel), feel free to [follow me on twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/barraider) .
