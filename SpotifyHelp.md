### COMMON ISSUES

1. I get `INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid Client URI` when I try to view my Approval Code. **Why?!**

    Please see **Step 6** above...

## **DONATIONS**

A lot of time, effort (and coffee) went into making this plugin work again. Donations are unnecessary but very much appreciated (and will help buy MORE coffee :)).<br>
